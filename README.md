# GRGridView

`GRGridView` is a simple grid scroll view for views in an iOS application. It is still in the very begining ant it requires a lot of testing. Right now anything can change.

The work is based on the awesome work of Kristopher Johnson in the [KJGridLayoutView](https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJGridLayout). The main difference is that the scroll view manages the layout implementation, also there is animation support.

## Contents

- **GRGridView** - A subclass of the UIScrollView that will manage the cells in the grid inside. There is no memory management right now.
- **GRGridConstraint** - A protocol for creating the cells you will add to the grid.

## Basic Usage

Please check the example in the source code.

## Cocoa Pods

Please donâ€™t add this to CocoaPods, it does not have a release version yet. If you still want to use add `pod 'GRGridView', :git => 'https://github.com/gabrielrinaldi/GRGridView.git'` to your Podfile.
